# Diabetes Prediction System
## Diabetes Prediction Dataset 🩺📊

### Overview
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

### Dataset Description 📋

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant 🤰
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration (a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test) 🍬
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 💉
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm) 📏
- **Insulin**: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) 💉
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2) ⚖️
- **Diabetes**: Diabetes pedigree function 📈
- **Age**: Age (years) 🎂
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1), where 1 indicates the presence of diabetes and 0 indicates the absence of diabetes ✅❌

### Usage 💡

This dataset can be used to build a model to predict the presence of diabetes in patients based on various medical predictor variables. The `Outcome` column is the target dependent variable, while the other columns serve as independent variables.

### File Format 📂

The dataset is provided in a CSV file format. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and software to read and manipulate CSV files.
